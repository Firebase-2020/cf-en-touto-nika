This is a a project to practice the cloud functions we'll need for en touto nika.

We're going to need the following cloud functions:

- 1. A CF that detects if a question is `created` and sends a message to the owner of the app, with all the necesary info to check if the question will be accepted.
- 2. A CF that detects if a question is `updated` and etc as above.
- 3. A CF for deleted questions...
